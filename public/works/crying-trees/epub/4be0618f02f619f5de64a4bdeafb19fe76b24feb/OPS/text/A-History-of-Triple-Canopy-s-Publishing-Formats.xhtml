<p><strong>Triple Canopy</strong> is a leading online magazine, which continues to pursue innovative formats for sharing and publishing criticism, digital artworks, and online content. This essay investigates the methods Triple Canopy uses to share content, and why they've made the choices they have in the evolution of their publishing platforms.</p>
<p>Started in 2007, Triple Canopy now publishes series of articles on their <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/">website</a>, which include sound, video, and interactive elements thanks to their online-only format. Their events also extend to symposiums and performances which extend the publishing format.</p>
<p>Triple Canopy is still a &quot;magazine,&quot; and uses the moniker to encompass their events and projects. Their annual Symposium on November 2nd treats itself as a &quot;<a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/triple-canopy-symposium-2024">manifestation of the magazine’s concerns and collaborations, in person and in real time</a>;&quot; even a live event is seen as a publication or issue of the magazine. Similarly, the publication formats Triple Canopy uses (custom-designed by the editors) foreground words and ideas in their content, but they have been engineered to exist as multimedia objects.</p>
<p>Arts editor Zach shares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It all fits into the same editorial eye or ethic, where we are most interested in having conversations and performances that are either formally inventive, are doing discipline/genre-agnostic and with discursive programs, we're most interested in people coming at familiar topics from unexpected angles or talking about something that's not being talked about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The formats Triple Canopy has evolved all fit into this ethos of encouraging cross-genre and wider thinking enabled by the Internet. But they have also struggled with the Internet as a format, changing strategy in response to a changing Internet. Caleb Waldorf shares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Each framework needs to be understood against the reading environments of the time. If you look at [them] now they might look old—there's an element of the Internet of the time we were responding to. I was making websites and had a more traditional video and performance practice, but there was always a discursive element: blogs, Wordpress and Drupal sites, mailing lists. A lot of cultural content was coming in those forms. Initially, we were asking: how can we reconfigure the experience of reading online? How can we create an immersive experience? It didn't exist; there wasn't anyone doing that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Triple Canopy was always motivated by an intention to &quot;slow down the Internet;&quot; to create a critical, &quot;immersive&quot; reading experience online. Common to all formats is a page-based, horizontal layout which contrasted the standard top-to-bottom scroll common to online articles. The horizontal method involves hacking, even fighting standard webpage formats—a negotiation that continues to this day. The formats all represent transient rebellions against the web of the time: incorporations of newfound capabilities (jQuery, SCSS for Alongslide, more dynamic media and formatting), but also efforts to work around the inherent opinions of browsers. According to Waldorf,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A significant portion of the time is spent on the layout and getting text to flow properly. There's all sorts of shims and weird crazy stuff. It still is a headache. It was awful from ALS...there were lots of hacks to get it to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, I discuss some of these hacks, and discuss the evolving strategy informing Triple Canopy within the changing Internet.</p>

        </figure>
        </div><h2>ALS</h2>
<p>ALS was the original intention of &quot;slowing down the Internet&quot; by adopting a page-based visual layout. One example of ALS is <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/a_note_on_unplaced_movements?tcapi:has_content_type=tc:contenttype_als">&quot;A Note on Unplaced Movements&quot;</a>, by the Triple Canopy editors. The format is not responsive, in that it has a fixed horizontal dimension and a 2-column format. It supports images, but appears very similar to how the layout would be printed in a magazine.</p>
<p>ALS was created in order to get the system up: Waldorf created it in collaboration with his friend Adam Pleurin. Waldorf shares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was the two of us, him handling frontend, and iterating, moving from wireframe to visual design to software, back and forth. It was often out of an eye for making things—building out functionality and frameworks for editors to think within: not just how projects were displayed and read but also marked up and written. Environmental spaces which then editors would work within, sometimes to their detriment and sometimes not. [...] We'd figure out how to do it, with modern technologies, and how it could be deployed. Developing and iterating until it was semifunctional, then doing maintenance on that thing for several years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Triple Canopy began as an artist collective with little funding; Waldorf had just exited an MFA and brought together a small team to begin work. Initially, editors worked within the HTML markup of documents themselves, so articles were designed within the digital format from initial conception to finished product.</p>

        <a href="figures-titlepage.xhtml#horizonize">

        </div><h2>Horizonize</h2>
<p>Released in 2010, <a href="https://github.com/triplecanopy/horizonize">Horizonize</a> is a plugin that transforms HTML content from a single vertically-scrolled page into horizontally-scrolling columns. Rather than the page-based standard, Horizonize switches to a set of thinner and more mobile columns, also employing the most popular JavaScript library at the time, jQuery, to perform custom manipulations of the webpage. At the time—and even still—the Web doesn't well support horizontal, column-based rendering style. Horizonize takes each block and, based on the browser's screen size, assembles the columns using JavaScript upon page load. The plugin takes content from one HTML element and inserts it into a fixed &quot;reader&quot; section.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/poems_for_america?tcapi:has_content_type=tc:contenttype_horizonize">&quot;Poems for America&quot;</a>, the format becomes far more flexible, as the reader advances by column instead of by page. Importantly, the page scales down for smaller screen widths, enabling reading by one column at a time. However, the layout remains static.</p>

        </a>
        </figure>
        </div><h2>Alongslide</h2>
<p>In many ways, <a href="https://github.com/triplecanopy/alongslide">Alongslide</a> is more flexible than Horizonize as it formats flowing text into whole-screen layouts dynamically, analyzing the current screen width before compiling. Alongslidealso featured a more intentional separation between writing and formatting: text could be supplied via Markdown—a simple notation for formatting text—which was then parsed and passed to the formatting. This pipeline paralleled a larger separation between editing and writing in Triple Canopy's organizational structure, as funding developed.</p>
<p>Alongside performs more intense manipulations of the webpage than Horizonize did: rather than pulling out individual columns that don't change much, the format takes flowing text, actively pulls out panels, and inserts them into the document, performing live formatting to the fullscreen browser page. Alongslide also uses a much fuller compiler, introducing metadata and a custom Markdown syntax; documents aren't written into HTML, but rather in Markdown for parsing before flowing into the text.</p>
<p>Alongslide reflected the growth in capabilities of the web, and an effort to showcase the richest displays a browser was capable of. Waldorf shares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In earlier versions you were setting column breaks—the name Alongslide comes from pinning panels; people didn't do that much. We were thinking about different temporalities: not just a linear progression, but anchoring media with text as it develops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/on-poetry-and-the-turntable?tcapi:has_content_type=tc:contentype_alongslide">&quot;On Poetry and the Turntable&quot;</a>, made with Alongslide, the page takes up the entire screen, eschewing the previous back and forward buttons at either side. This makes it feel much less like a framed print page and more native to the online format.</p>
<p>But Alongslide also met its end; particularly, mobile browsers began to take more precedence, and readers couldn't be expected to conform to the desktop, or laptop, environment. Alongslide's Markdown parser also lacked standardization: it was an experiment with Markdown directives, but these were all inconsistent, emerging on a case-by-case basis from projects.</p>
<p>The Internet continues to frustrate creatives. As a software structure, it is built on standard modalities shaped around marketing, ads, and the endless scroll. Some of the developments leading to B-ber involve transitioning away from the browser as a tool in the first place.</p>

        </div><h2>B-ber</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>B-ber is an open-source framework for creating and circulating publications as websites, EPUBs, books, and other formats. B-ber also functions as a browser-based EPUB reader, which explains the name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>B-ber has persisted for the longest in Triple Canopy's history, in use since 2017 and currently in &quot;maintenance mode.&quot; It is a very different approach than the other frameworks: it compiles EPUB ebooks which can be read in-browser or downloaded, also targeting InDesign layouts for print.</p>
<p>B-ber allows much more fluid scrolling within a single horizontal page: for example, in <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/if-the-limbs?tcapi:has_content_type=tc:contenttype_bber&amp;tcapi:all_people=tc:person_52228c9902e3e620b10000a5">&quot;If the Limbs Grow Too Large for the Body&quot;</a>. The formatting is more seamless, and an intuitive interface incorporates a table of contents, navigations buttons, and resembles more familiar E-readers. Video, audio, and full-page images are supported.</p>
<p>B-ber is based around &quot;simultaneously consider[ing] the ideal manifestation of a publication and the multiplicity of scenarios in which it will be encountered&quot; (&quot;Working On Our Thoughts&quot;). Rather than designing a publication for what you view, you design a more abstract manifestation of the work and then specify how it will exist in multiple formats.</p>
<p>B-ber expands the scope of what Triple Canopy targets, accommodating an Internet that has become more social-media driven than before. Waldorf reflects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2007, I was generating experimental publishing frameworks consistently. Now I don't feel like a lot of cultural work is offline and within closed ecosystems. When someone wants to start a new project space, their first inclination is to do Instagram, not a website. Partially I don't see as many of these generations doing the kind of work of making websites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Editor Zach shares that Triple Canopy began navigating the new Internet during the mid-2010s regarding the need for digital marketing: &quot;There was this bigger feeling of community from the editors themselves sharing things, and if you shared it you would actually see it. Around 2015-2016 that stopped—we started having to pay or play all sorts of [marketing] games.&quot;</p>
<p>B-ber is responsive to the Internet's increasing capability to distract.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In general there's a feeling is that the browser is shouldn't be the primary vehicle for content distribution, that the Internet is an awful place. So using formats that can be circulated and read outside of a browser context. Most publishers don't do that, but we felt strongly about offline being beneficial to immersion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>B-Ber can be seen as the culmination of &quot;responsive&quot; design, a concept that emerged in response (no pun intended) to the radically different screen sizes available to online readers. Rather than simply scaling down content, B-ber offers writers opportunities for flexibility and implicates an equal flexibility in publication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept and architecture of B-ber hinge on this understanding of the correspondences and movements between media. To simultaneously publish in multiple formats using the same source is to take advantage of the fluidity of Web-based publishing, and it also involves questioning the role of design in the creation of a digital object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This flexibility is only possible because the work is decomposed into multiple files—a plaintext file for the text, separate scripts and stylesheets for the design, and additional downstream customizations for each publishing format. B-ber is ideally an open framework to combine various specialties and skillsets, which allows those with differing abilities to work in a single project together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amateurs and experts, writers and coders, should be able to work with the text that is to be parsed by the software. [...] B-ber introduces to the practice of writing and editing the semantic structure of the EPUB, which is essential in understanding how text that is written in a word-processing program is ultimately expressed in various formats, whether in code or print&quot; (&quot;Working&quot;).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>B-ber also accompanies a transition into a more classic staffing structure; Triple Canopy began paying staff in 2009 thanks to a grant from the Warhol Foundation, and by the mid-2010s, editors and designers were integrated into more defined roles. B-ber facilitated a separation of concerns. Design no longer</p>
<p>There is power in open standards, within the limitations they impose. Just as it is a standard for openness, B-ber uses the EPUB format to enable collaboration between forms. Accepting the standard involves working the format into the larger sphere of digital publishing, which consists primarily in EPUBs rather than experimental websites. The contradiction between standardization and openness enables B-ber to be open-source, bypassing its earlier customizations for a format that's easier to understand.</p>
<p>As digital represented an escape from the offline, the offline now represents an escape from the digital. I move to considering the motion offline accompanying B-ber: how Triple Canopy exists nowadays is a continuation of its digital presence, but one that encapsulates a more-than-online vision.</p>
