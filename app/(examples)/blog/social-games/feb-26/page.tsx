      <h2>Response to Game Design Fundamentals</h2>

        "All new media objects, whether created from scratch on computers or
        converted from analog media sources, are composed of digital code; they
        are numerical representations…. A new media object can be described
        formally (mathematically). —Lev Manovich, The Language of New Media"
      </p>
      <p>
        I was designing a website for a client this week, and she kept using
        left and right arrow keys to scroll through an image carousel. I
        realized I hadn't input that functionality; an example of an implicit
        rule. As a web designer and not a game designer, I approach games from
        the outside-in—starting with UX/UI, then defining operational rules (web
        menus, page structure) and not often considering what the "constitutive
        rules" of a website might be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps these constitutive rules—or their absence—separate game from
        play. I'm interested in operating in the space between play and game;
        especially because I want to design puzzles, interactive texts, and
        games that fall outside the "Hollywood" conventions—acknowledging the
        medium's materiality as a screen/pixel object.
      </p>
      <p>
        But part of the materiality of the digital is the fact that a program is
        a Turing-complete formal system—the operations of binary logic and
        philosophical, mathematical formalism shaped the development of
        computers. Perhaps that binary logic is changing; I'm considering
        generative AI, with its black-box nature, and the massive computational
        leaps of quantum computing. Can a game escape such a clean-cut formal
        definition, through generative ecosystems and feedback algorithms that
        create a more organic feel?
