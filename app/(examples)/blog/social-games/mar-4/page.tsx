      <h2>Response to Ch 8: Defining Digital Games</h2>
      <p>
        Timing is often paramount in digital games in a way that is more akin to
        playing a sport with another person. Games are of course social, but I'm
        also interested in the meditated social interaction that constitutes the
        game. A "black box" is the fundamental nature of game design; even board
        games have distinctive rules for probability that are difficult to
        deduce from the rules themselves. For example, designing a game within
        the standard deck of cards involves shuffling and different "hands"
        which emerge explot the probabilities in the deck; winning the game may
        perhaps become a judgement of probabilities.

        Narrow interaction is also an intriguing facet of digital games. We have
        the capacity to design interfaces but at the same time much of my
        digital interaction is spent on a standard laptop, with a trackpad and
        keyboard. This interface is quite limiting. However, I also just tried
        the Apple Vision Pro, which uses eyetracking and gestures to control 2D
        interfaces. The standard point-and-click of the finger still remained,
        but this time incorporated into eye and hand movement. Touchscreens also
        represent an evolution of the point-and-click interface.

        I like point-and-click as a principle of digital interaction: this
        rudimentary concept of adjusting a single position and selecting
        interaction. How could this particular mode of interaction, with its
        narrowness and also its simplicity, become an interface for more complex
        graphics and "black-box" systems? The ultimate simplicity of interaction
        paired with a complex game mechanic can often produce the most engaging
        results.
